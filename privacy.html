                <h1>Privacy policy</h1>

                <p>
                    At Shinosawa Laboratory, we believe that privacy is a right.
                    We want to empower our users to be the masters of their
                    identity. In this privacy policy, we want to help you
                    understand how and why Shinosawa Laboratory (“Shinosawa
                    Laboratory,“ “we“ or “us”) collects, uses, and shares
                    information about you when you use our websites, mobile
                    apps, widgets, APIs, emails, and other online products and
                    services (collectively, the “Services“) or when you
                    otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from
                    us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We want this privacy policy to empower you to make better
                    choices about how you use Shinosawa Laboratory. We'd love
                    for you to read the whole policy, but if you don't, here is
                    the TL;DR:
                </p>

                <h2>Shinosawa Laboratory is a public platform.</h2>

                <p>
                    Our communities are largely public and anyone can see your
                    profile, posts, and comments.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We collect minimal information that can be used to identify
                    you by default. If you want to just browse, you don't need
                    an account. If you want to create an account to participate
                    in Shinosawa Laboratory, we don't require you to give us
                    your real name. We don't track your precise location. You
                    can even browse anonymously. You can share as much or as
                    little about yourself as you want when using Shinosawa
                    Laboratory.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We only use data to make Shinosawa Laboratory a better
                    place.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Any data we collect is used primarily to provide our
                    Services, which are focused on allowing people to come
                    together and form communities. We don't sell your personal
                    data to third parties, and we never work with data brokers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All of our users get privacy rights - not just those in
                    select countries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Any data we collect is used primarily to provide our
                    Services, which are focused on allowing people to come

                </p>

                <p>If you have questions about how we use data, just ask.</p>

                <p>
                    We've tried our best to make this as easy to understand as
                    possible but sometimes privacy policies are still confusing.
                    If you need help understanding this policy or anything about
                    Shinosawa Laboratory, just ask.

                <p>
                    Much of the information on the Services is public and
                    accessible to everyone, even without an account. By using
                    the Services, you are directing us to share this information
                    publicly and freely.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you submit content (e.g., a post, comment, or chat
                    message) to a public part of the Services, any visitors to
                    and users of our Services will be able to see that content,
                    the username associated with the content, and the date and
                    time you originally submitted the content. That content and
                    information may also be available in search results on
                    Internet search engines like Google or in responses provided
                    by an AI chatbot like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. You should take the
                    public nature of the Services into consideration before
                    posting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your Shinosawa Laboratory account has a profile page that is
                    public. Your profile contains information about your
                    activities on the Services, such as your username, prior
                    posts and comments, karma, trophies received, profile
                    display name, about section, and social links, avatar or
                    profile image, moderator, contributor, and Shinosawa
                    Laboratory Premium status, communities you are active in,
                    and how long you have been a member of the Services (your
                    cake day).
                </p>

                <p>
                    We offer social sharing features that let you share content
                    or actions you take on our Services with other media. Your
                    use of these features enables the sharing of certain
                    information with your friends or the public, depending on
                    the settings you establish with the third party that
                    provides the social sharing feature. For more information
                    about the purpose and scope of data collection and
                    processing in connection with social sharing features,
                    please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that
                    provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr,
                    Facebook, and X).
